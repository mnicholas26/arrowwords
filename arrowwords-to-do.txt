Notes:

To do - * indicates a note:
Decide on my objects and data structures
Implement the json words into this structure
Refactor words.js clues bit to subdivide the clues into a more semantic list where necessary
Decide on the algorithm which will populate the grid backend
Make method to populate grid frontend
refactor code
* At this point the grid should populate and be filled in automatically
Create method to hide the completed in aspect of the grid - method will be reused later
Dynamically create the grid using js to create dom elements
Add in user input functionality
Link method created above for removing completed with the changes made by adding user functionality
Make when the grid is created and populated behind the scenes but with nothing filled in for the user
Create splash screen in static html
From splash screen the 'play' button should call the function to dynamically create the grid
Create the methods for validating the user input and decide how the validation is displayed - see notes
Create the buttons which will hook to previously created methods of new grid/validation/clearing board
Have the buttons be created automatically like the grid when play is pressed on the splash screen


Completed:
Import word list to project
Create grid in static html
Create a new json file from word list with all the fluff removed
